# `texr`
_Simple_ but _extensive_ functionalities for passing R objects to TeX.

I have made extensive use of the `xtable` and `texreg` packages, but have ultimately found them too inflexible (see, _e.g._, [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30017129/texreg-ing-multiple-multinom-models), [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37402445/adding-multicolumns-to-my-texreg-output), [3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30902906/wrapping-custom-notes-in-texreg-output), [4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29403051/texreg-ing-tobit-output-from-zelig-package-r), [5](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13984470/possible-to-create-latex-multicolumns-in-xtable), etc.) and stale (_i.e._, it's not typical to be able to propose and implement bug fixes/feature requests with expedience).

Feel free to leave suggested functionalities on the [Issues](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/texr/issues) page.
